# My first Angular project

It is a simple web site, which shows all countries (cities) in the world, which I have visited with information about the population, coordinates, and so on. Google map is integrated to show the selected destination. There is also a form to add new visited places. Login and registration are needed to use the site.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Dependencies 

kinvey-angular-sdk - used for connecting with the back-end of Kinvey.
ngx-toastr - used to show notifications on the front-end.
Other dependencies you can find in package.json.

## Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Because the Kinvey back-end is not free anymore, the project will not work properly.
